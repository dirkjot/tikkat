# Tikkat
Platform support ticket system using Slack and Airtable

When your team has to handle a slow but steady trickle of support tickets (say 2 to 20 a day), you need 
some type of system to handle them.  Many of the commercial solutions are too heavy-handed and not built 
for support tickets that mainly/only come in via Slack.  

Tikkat is a system to deal with this situation.  It is not perfect, but easy to set up, simple to manage, and 
if you feel the need to extend it, you find it does a lot in a small Python code base.
